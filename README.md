## About me

I am a software developer with over 10 years of work experience, more than 6 years spanning in mobile application development. I have developed apps for both iOS and Android devices. My apps have been downloaded over 500K times with more than 50K active users.

I am passionate about creating apps that are both functional and visually appealing. I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and learn new technologies.

In my spare time I like to learn new technologies and implement cool ideas.
